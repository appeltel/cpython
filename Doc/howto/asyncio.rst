.. topic:: Abstract

   This tutorial explains python coroutines (async/await) and the motivation
   for using them to provide structure for applications using asynchronous IO.
   The asyncio event loop from the python standard library is used for
   scheduling coroutines and providing low-level IO operations.

   This tutorial should provide you with the background necessary to begin
   writing applications that make use of python coroutines.
